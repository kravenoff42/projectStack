Project Stack

should show a dynamic visual of 1-6 projects

Scaled based on importance,
the number of point determines the size of the tiles,
  points based on
x1-2    -date created (the older the higher)
bool    -last modified anything inactive for more than 3 months gets archived
x1.1    -easily monetized
x1.1    -easily completed
x1.2    -interesting Domain
x1.2    -involves working with others
bool    -already outlined (deal breaker)
x1-2    -Due date (the closer the larger)
x1.5    -will be useful for dev work
x1.2    -is a prereq for other proj
x2.0    -getting paid for it

tiles will link to code base

anything without a outline will be shifted to todo list (link to readme)

Look into hosting database with google sheets
 -if using this, needs to get Auth from google on load up
